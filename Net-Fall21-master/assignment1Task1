What happens when you try to send to a non-IU email address? Why?
When I try to send to a non-IU email address it tells me that I can’t do that since I don’t have proper authentication. This is because a non-IU email address is not on the IU network and it could lead to a security breach, so only certain people have the authentication to send emails to non-IU email addresses.

What happens when you use a made-up from address? Why?
When I put in a made up address it worked and allowed me to send the email to an IU address. For my case I sent the message test from JackSchwartz2001@iu.edu (a fake address) to my IU email and I got the email saying it was from Jackschwartz2001@iu.edu.
